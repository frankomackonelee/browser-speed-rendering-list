# browser-speed-rendering-list
A quick project to look at how feasible it is to view 10s of 1000s of elements in a list with accompanying icons (pngs or font-awesome).  
Html, native Javascript (and JQuery & Bootstrap but these could be easily stripped out)

The reason for making this was to see whether tree view pluggins which add elements to the dom could feasibly cope with these numbers of nodes on display at one time.
